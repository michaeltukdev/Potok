# Potok

**Potok** is a secure, cross-platform, self-hosted CLI tool for automatically syncing and backing up [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vaults (or technically anything) with end-to-end encryption. Potok is free, open-source, and designed for privacy and flexibility.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Vaults are encrypted locally before uploading to server; only you hold the keys.
- **Self-Hosted:** As a fan of self-hosting, you run your own Potok serverâ€”no third-party cloud required.
- **Multiple Vaults:** You can easily sync and manage multiple vaults independently of one another.
- **Automatic Sync:** Detects changes within vaults and syncs them automatically
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows and Linux (Untested on MacOS - would appreciate if someone could do this for me).
- **CLI-Based:** For simplicity, we currently only support CLI through commands (potentially a GUI in the future)
- **Secure Key Storage:** Your encryption keys and API keys never leave your operating system, they're stored within your OS keyring.
- **No Vendor Lock-in:** Free and open-source.

## Getting Started

## Usage

### **Configure the Client**

### **List Your Vaults**

### **Sync a Vault (WIP)**

## Commands

| Command            | Description                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `set-api-url`      | Set the Potok server URL                    |
| `set-api-key`      | Set your API key (stored securely)          |
| `list-vaults`      | List all your vaults on the server          |
| `sync`             | Sync your vaults (automatic, coming soon)   |
| `upload`           | Encrypt and upload a new vault (planned)    |
| `download`         | Download and decrypt a vault (planned)      |

## Configuration

Potok stores your configuration in `~/.potok/config.json`:

```json
{
  "api_url": "http://localhost:8080",
}
```

API keys and vault passwords are stored securely in your OS keyring.


## Security

- All data is encrypted locally before upload.
- The server never sees your passwords or unencrypted data.
- API keys and passwords are never displayed after being set.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Automatic file watching and sync
- [ ] File-level sync and conflict handling
- [ ] Web dashboard for server admin
- [ ] Cross-platform installer
- [ ] More documentation and examples
